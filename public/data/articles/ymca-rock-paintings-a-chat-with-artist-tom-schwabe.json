If so, you’ve got local artist Tom Schwabe to thank, who has kindly answered some questions!</i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Before you took up Rock Painting, what was your occupation?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Industrial Sales – copper-based materials.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Are you a native of the Doylestown area?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Yes, since I was 14 – prior in the Springfield Delaware County.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>How long have you been an artist?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Since I was young… I always loved to draw.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>While you were working, what was your main median?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">When I did artwork, I did pencil sketch/pen and ink.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>What inspired you to paint the rocks outside of the YMCA?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">When the YMCA closed, I painted a rock saying, “I miss you” and this is how it started. From that point, I kept doing them weekly.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>How long have you been painting the rocks at the YMCA?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">About 3 years – since Covid in 2020.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Did the pandemic affect your art in anyway?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">It inspired me to do more artwork and get busy painting. I was able to drop rocks at the entrance of the YMCA.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>What do you like to paint on the rocks? Anything in particular?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">I do various subject matter… cartoon characters, flags of allied nations, tributes to police and emergency workers, logos of schools and companies, etc.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Do you have set themes that you like to follow in your art?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">No, I just do anything.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>If someone was interested in getting into rock painting, what are some words of advice you could give them?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Know how to layout the rocks so that they are not harmed by weather and pursue subjects that you are interested in like nature, cartoons, etc… Also, spray them first with spray paint, and I use acrylics from the local craft store.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Thank you, Tom, for making Doylestown brighter!</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_17278\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-17278\" style=\"width: 326px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"/data/media/image0.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-17278\" src=\"/data/media/image0.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"326\" height=\"760\" srcset=\"/data/media/image0.jpeg 326w, /data/media/image0-129x300.jpeg 129w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 326px) 100vw, 326px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-17278\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tom Schwabe</figcaption></figure>\n",
