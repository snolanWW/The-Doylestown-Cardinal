St. Paul’s always went above and beyond, making each house spectacular and unique.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Over the past 29 years, this event has raised over $193,500 to benefit the Doylestown Homeless Shelter, operated by the Bucks County Housing Group. Last year the event committee decided to change the tour to be an outside decorating competition, a drive by tour, and called it the Christmas in Doylestown Re-Imagined House Tour.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\">This was a huge success and brought much needed holiday cheer during such a bleak time! Harvey Avenue won the “Best Neighborhood” competition by decorating their street as “Candy Cane Lane”. They donated their $500 winnings to the Doylestown Community Food Pantry. The “Best House”, on Bridge Street, was awarded to the Farinas who donated their winnings to the Fiaria Project, which supports foster families through their transitions. </span><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">This year, due to the ongoing pandemic, St Paul’s is preparing for a similar safe and free holiday experience: 2021 Christmas in Doylestown ‘Outdoor Lights Tour’. There are 4 categories this year; “Most Fun for Kids”, “Best Themed Display”, “Best Front Door”, and “Most Creative Illumination”.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Each winner will receive a $250 award to grant to a local charity of their choice. Like last year, the winners will be determined by the community through online voting.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Please help us spread the word and register your house to join in on the fun!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">The tour territory includes the borough and the neighborhood of Doylestown Hunt (from the rumors, this neighborhood is worth the extra drive). The deadline to register your house in the competition is December 5th, and the event will take place from December 10th to 19th from 5pm to 9pm. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Register your home here: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/CIDform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://bit.ly/CIDform</a></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Access Virtual Map and Voting after Dec. 5th here:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span><a href=\"https://www.stpaulsdoylestown.org/cid-2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.stpaulsdoylestown.org/cid-2021</a></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Follow on Facebook at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stpaulcmas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.facebook.com/stpaulcmas</a></span></p>\n",
