Thankfully, Inge Stannik has shared her top tips on how to manage the 2022 – 2023 upcoming term.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></i></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Tell us about your time teaching in the Central Bucks School District?</p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">I worked for the Central Bucks School District from 1999 until 2022 and taught grades 8 – 12. I began as a long-term substitute in German and ended as a full-time high school Biology teacher. My German and Biology students called me “Frau” (which, by the way, is totally inappropriate in the German context as it means “Mrs.” or “woman”.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Imagine!). <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">TIPS FOR TEACHERS:</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\"><strong>• Stay true to yourself</strong>…</span><span class=\"s1\">The teaching profession can be all-consuming.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Celebrate, strengthen, and share your own gifts and celebrate those of others equally so.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s2\">• Prioritize the work load</span></strong><span class=\"s1\">…Rather than try to find more time to do all the things you want to do with your class, find ways to make the important things happen.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s2\">• Don’t forget about your wellbeing</span></strong><span class=\"s1\">… prioritizing means you can practice self-care and enrichment, and feel like a rested, understanding, and motivating human each day you enter the classroom.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s2\">• Respect and know your students</span></strong><span class=\"s1\">…Create an environment where your students have choices and see connections to their world. Acknowledge their frustrations and resolve them together.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s2\">• Stay up to date</span></strong><span class=\"s1\">…Incorporating popular trends constructively rather than bucking them, and sharing the lore of times gone by all help to keep things fresh, inspirational, relevant, and real for kids.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s2\">• Find a comfortable routine</span></strong><span class=\"s1\">…In order to create a base on which all students can function, finding a comfortable routine for students (with a surprise thrown in there regularly) is a good place to start.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>TIPS FOR STUDENTS:</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s2\">• Challenge yourself</span></strong><span class=\"s1\">…Students should challenge themselves as best they can and try to be open to challenges posed by others.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s2\">• Find what works best for you</span></strong><span class=\"s1\">…As teachers, one of our many jobs is to ask students to seek to recognize their passions, strengths, and areas for growth. Find what learning tools, strategies for time management and organization methods work best for your success.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s2\">• Academics aren’t for everyone</span></strong><span class=\"s1\">…For some, choosing school as a full-time focus is a great fit. For others, extracurriculars will be the life-line to the next phase in life.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>TIPS FOR PARENTS &amp; GUARDIANS</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s2\">• Acknowledge the importance of school in your student’s life</span></strong><span class=\"s1\">…Jobs can feel like drudgery. A student’s job is school. If an adult takes interest in a student’s job (school) and openly recognizes and supports the efforts of the student, discussing successes and failures, getting excited, curious, or even disbelieving about content, the student themselves will feel excitement and greater meaning for the opportunities school brings.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s2\">• Each child is differen</span></strong><span class=\"s1\"><strong>t</strong>…Many assignments or jobs in life ask for commitment. The challenge for an adolescent to be a good student and do their best in school is one of those jobs. From my own children, I recognize that each student varies in life goals and ambitions, thus the level of commitment will be different for each child. This is okay.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong><span class=\"s2\">• There is success beyond the classroom</span></strong><span class=\"s1\">… Perhaps being a “B” or “C” student and finding joy in activities offered outside of the classroom is the life balance that one adolescent needs. As adults, part of our job seems to be encouraging a child to be a great version of themselves, regardless of how they fit into the established school system.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Finally, Inge would like to wish everyone in the community a manageable transition into the new academic year, with understanding and compassion towards all. It’s a big transition. Happy retirement Inge!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><i>Lily Appleby is a senior at Central Bucks West High School and has a passion for literature and writing.
