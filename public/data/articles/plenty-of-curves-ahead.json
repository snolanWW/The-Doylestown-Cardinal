Think circular coffee tables, curved and fluted cabinet and console facades, kidney-shaped sofas, rounded swivel chairs, round and oval dining tables, dining chairs with curved backs… Curves everywhere!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">While there are many curved furniture pieces with wildly imaginative and futuristic forms, it is possible to translate this trend into something that works well in typical Bucks County homes.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">Shown here, I designed a luxurious example that brings to mind the glamour of the 1930s with its sumptuous materials and clean lines. A look like this can work as well in a traditional setting as it can in a contemporary one.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">If your vibe is more modern, there are very mod options and retro-inspired items reminiscent of the 1960s.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">Curves have been described as playful, fun, calming, comforting, inviting, graceful, glamorous, and sensual. After the last couple of challenging years, people want to feel cozy and happy. It’s no wonder that curves are back in a big way.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">Curved sofas look great in solid colors and show off particularly well in boucle, velvet, and mohair fabric treatments. These fabrics look lovely and feel great against the skin when you’re seated on them too. In my opinion, luxury is defined by more than looks. I believe luxury is equally about how an item feels. It’s treating yourself to those little indulgences that make your life a little sweeter. Performance fabrics can create these looks practical as well. Channel tufting is a popular way to add additional detail to curved upholstered pieces.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">In rooms large enough to float your seating arrangement in the center of the room, a curved sofa can be a sculptural statement piece. They shine best in floated arrangements away from walls. The curves can soften the hard edges of the room. And of course, round tables complement the curved sofa.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">In smaller rooms, you can use rounded edges on tables to soften the space. This is a trend that I expect to stick around for a while.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">Incorporating a piece is a great way to introduce a fresh look to your rooms. Consider curves if you’re looking to boost the sensation of comfort and shelter in your home.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><i>Victoria Guillot is a home stager/interior designer of 15 years based in Doylestown.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>A 6-time Best of Houzz winner, she has been featured on a 26-episode radio series and is author of a book of tips on home staging.
