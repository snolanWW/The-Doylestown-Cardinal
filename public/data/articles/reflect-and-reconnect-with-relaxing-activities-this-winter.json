The dark, cold, January days lend themselves to introspection and I embrace the slow pace the winter weather brings. Finding activities that aid me in my January renewal is key to starting a new year reconnected and rejuvenated. Here are a few of my favorites. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong>Reconnect With Nature</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">Walking through the silent winter woods at night was a staple of my childhood. My mom would lead my brother and me deep into the forest following the deer trails winding through the tall trees. We followed along in our snow gear, our little bodies making our own warmth under the bulky layers. The crunch of our heavy boots, the swish of our windproof sleeves, rhythmically accompanying us on our trek. Our minds emptied of daytime thoughts, pushed out by the stimuli our senses were taking in. Suddenly, we stopped, complete silence pervaded. We held our breath as my mom called out deep into the night whoo-hoo, hoo-whoo-hoo. Moments later came the hauntingly beautiful response. We had found our great horned owl! My mom and I now bring my children on night walks in the woods to search for these magical creatures. It is a moment for me to reconnect with my childhood and reflect on the role nature has always had in my life. It allows me to clear my thoughts and realign my senses.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">The Owl Prowl is a family tradition we are passing down to my children, a moment to share our love of nature, to slow our pace, and simply enjoy one another. Join us on Friday, January 12 at the Bucks County Audubon Society in Solebury for a 7pm Owl Prowl Night Walk. You can hear my mom’s beautiful owl call for yourself.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">$5 members, $10 non-members</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">Bucks County Audubon Society<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">2877 Creamery Rd., New Hope, PA</p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><i>For details and to register, visit <a href=\"http://www.bcas.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.bcas.org<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></a></i></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><i>or call 215-297-5880</i></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong>Reflect, Realign, And Recenter</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">Shanteel Yoga Sanctuary is housed in a beautiful historic sawmill in downtown Sellersville. Upon crossing the threshold, I feel the warmth of this yoga community. Passion, acceptance, and tranquility permeate the space and envelope me as I slip off my shoes and climb the wooden staircase to the main studio. The candlelight of this evening’s Vinyasa class illuminates the exposed red brick walls, paned casement windows, and luminous hardwood floors. As I move through the poses, I reflect on my inner needs, realign my thoughts, and renew my mental strength. I rest in a child’s pose, giving my body grace as it releases the past year and prepares to move forward with the new one. As I send out my final Om, I am recentered.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">January 1: 10 -11 am New Year’s Day Yoga and Live Music Celebration.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">All month: 21 classes are offered each week for all levels, plus workshops and retreats.

Being around horses now returns me to those youthful days spent riding in the woods, bareback in the pastures, and caring for these gentle, intuitive creatures. As an adult, I no longer have horses in my daily life. Bringing my three children and husband to historic Bethlehem for a horse-drawn carriage ride through the old town allows me to reconnect with the majesty and magic horses emanate.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">Under the twinkling white lights of the revived steel town’s Main Street, we climb into our red sleigh pulled by three magnificent grey Percherons. The leather tack squeaks as Jace, Jade, and Jay pull us forward, each beauty weighing a powerful 1000 pounds. Their steel-shod hooves clop rhythmically down the quaint streets and I feel myself keeping time to their beat.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">Clip-clop, clip-clop; my memories flood back with recollections of my young, carefree, self, happily riding through the woods with my mom. Clip-clop, clip-clop; I reconnect with my deep-rooted passion for horses. Clip-clop, clip-clop; my children’s beautiful voices rise and fall to the Percherons’ music.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">Private and group carriage rides for all ages. Guided horseback trail rides for ages 13 and up.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">Bethlehem Carriage Company – Bethlehem, PA<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><i>For details visit <a href=\"http://www.Bethlehemcarriage.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.Bethlehemcarriage.com<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></a></i></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><i>or call 610-730-4973</i></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong>Dining in Bethlehem</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">McCarthy’s Red Stag Pub and Whiskey Bar is a delightful option to grab a bite before your carriage ride. My family loved the hearty lamb stew and the boar burger. To warm up after your ride, I recommend the Irish coffee made with their own Grannymac’s homemade Irish Cream liqueur. The skillet cookie dessert is a delicious combination of hot cookies and ice cream served on a personal hot skillet. My kids approved!<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><a href=\"http://www.redstagpub.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i>www.redstagpub.com</i></a></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong>Resonate And Reflect</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">When I was a child, our old, stone house in Carversville resonated with the blue notes of jazz echoing off the walls. My father was in the music industry, and I grew up on a steady diet of Miles Davis, Thelonius Monk, and Dave Brubeck. I woke to Dexter Gordon, did homework to John Coltrane, and went to sleep with Billie and Ella. Time and trends have pulled me away from jazz, but the notes still beat inside of me. The McCarter Theater in Princeton celebrates the 85th anniversary of Blue Note Records, the longest-running jazz label in the world.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">The Blue Note Quintet’s performance will honor the label’s iconic history and showcase its current talent. I look forward to the blue notes resonating through me once more as I reflect on my past, the history of this truly American style of music, and the gift of jazz that my father left me.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">January 25, 2024 at 7:30 pm: Blue Note Records 85th Anniversary Celebration<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">      </span>Tickets start at $25</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">McCarter Theater<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">91 University Place, Princeton NJ 08540</p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s4\"><i>For tickets, visit <a href=\"http://www.mccarter.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.mccarter.org</a> or call 609-258-2787</i></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong>Rejuvenate With A Rescue</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s5\">Holding a warm, furry, animal baby provides a soft embrace during the cold winter months. My children and I snuggle the babies in the warm barn at Rose Bridge Farm and Sanctuary. The silky soft goats and fuzzy kittens lap their milk from bottles as we hold them in our arms. Tiny faces, tiny heartbeats, tiny living beings for us to nourish. Silence settles over us as we listen only to them drink, feeling them swallow as their bellies get full. Endorphins abound as we feed and cuddle these little beings. The animals at Rose Bridge were all rescued, saved from a difficult path to luckily end up here, snuggled on our laps. I remember the many rescues of my childhood; the raccoon babies left stranded in the high oak when their mama didn’t return, the wee little flying squirrel found abandoned and alone. The Rose Bridge farm has many opportunities throughout the month to snuggle these rescued loves. The sanctuary also has piglets and baby camels to feed, goat yoga, animal husbandry classes, craft workshops, and an organic lavender farm.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">Rose Bridge Farm and Sanctuary<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\">1314 Limekiln Pike, Dresher PA</p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><i>For details and to register,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></i></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><i>visit <a href=\"http://www.rosebridgefarmsanctuary.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.rosebridgefarmsanctuary.com<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></a></i></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><i>Adrienne grew up roaming the magical woods of Carversville on horseback.
