The foundational treatment is light therapy, delivering noticeable skin improvements, especially for acne, within months. To further enhance results, they consider diet optimization essential, targeting hidden dietary influences on skin health. For persistent skin conditions, their comprehensive program includes extensive lab testing over three months, examining everything from hormone levels to liver function. This approach is grounded in the successful personal healing journey of founder Evan Transue, who advocates for the body’s innate ability to heal with proper care. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\">Beyond skincare, the center offers red light therapy for overall wellness, an infrared sauna for detox and circulation, and a smart-tech tanning bed for a safe, individualized tan.
