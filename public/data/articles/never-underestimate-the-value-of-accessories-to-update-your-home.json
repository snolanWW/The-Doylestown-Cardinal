Most often, I’ve been asked to update spaces. Whether you’re selling your home and want to update to attract more buyers or want a fresh look in the home where you live, you want the house to reflect current tastes. If you’ve been living with your things for a long time, you may want it to feel refreshed and different. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Through the years, I’ve seen certain common scenarios over and over and over again. Let’s use a simple example and talk about the entry foyer.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Here is a “Before” example of a very typical foyer design in Bucks County executive homes that I frequently encounter. Cut-crystal lamps and vases used to read as very formal, but now they risk looking dated when coupled with brown wood. The oil painting is top quality but small compared to the current “bigger is better” design trend. So how do we update this space?</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"/data/media/image1.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12192\" src=\"/data/media/image1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1170\" height=\"878\" srcset=\"/data/media/image1.jpeg 1170w, /data/media/image1-300x225.jpeg 300w, /data/media/image1-768x576.jpeg 768w, /data/media/image1-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, /data/media/image1-74x55.jpeg 74w, /data/media/image1-111x83.jpeg 111w, /data/media/image1-215x161.jpeg 215w, /data/media/image1-990x743.jpeg 990w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">Most people think they must throw out everything and start from scratch to get a new look. I’m here to show you that you don’t have to throw it all out to change the look and feel of a space completely. The power of accessories is tremendous! As a designer who believes in upcycling as much as possible, I love giving new life to old pieces that may be sentimental by changing out the accessories. Let’s take our first example:</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"/data/media/image2.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12193\" src=\"/data/media/image2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1165\" height=\"874\" srcset=\"/data/media/image2.jpeg 1165w, /data/media/image2-300x225.jpeg 300w, /data/media/image2-768x576.jpeg 768w, /data/media/image2-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, /data/media/image2-74x55.jpeg 74w, /data/media/image2-111x83.jpeg 111w, /data/media/image2-215x161.jpeg 215w, /data/media/image2-990x743.jpeg 990w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1165px) 100vw, 1165px\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">We kept the furniture and swapped the accessories for larger, more contemporary items with clean lines. We added drama with color in the art. The smaller pieces from the before image are re-used elsewhere but in different groupings that make them feel fresher. For example, we can move the painting to the powder room, which will be more in proportion and elevate that space.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Here’s another example with a completely different vibe using items inspired by nature:</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"/data/media/image3.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12194\" src=\"/data/media/image3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"977\" height=\"733\" srcset=\"/data/media/image3.jpeg 977w, /data/media/image3-300x225.jpeg 300w, /data/media/image3-768x576.jpeg 768w, /data/media/image3-74x55.jpeg 74w, /data/media/image3-111x83.jpeg 111w, /data/media/image3-215x161.jpeg 215w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Here are two more examples that look completely different using the same furniture with more exotic accessories:</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"/data/media/image4.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12195\" src=\"/data/media/image4.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"904\" height=\"678\" srcset=\"/data/media/image4.jpeg 904w, /data/media/image4-300x225.jpeg 300w, /data/media/image4-768x576.jpeg 768w, /data/media/image4-74x55.jpeg 74w, /data/media/image4-111x83.jpeg 111w, /data/media/image4-215x161.jpeg 215w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/data/media/image5.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-12196\" src=\"/data/media/image5.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"907\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"/data/media/image5.jpeg 907w, /data/media/image5-300x225.jpeg 300w, /data/media/image5-768x576.jpeg 768w, /data/media/image5-74x55.jpeg 74w, /data/media/image5-111x83.jpeg 111w, /data/media/image5-215x161.jpeg 215w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px\" /></a></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Hopefully, these examples have convinced you to look at accessories with a whole new sense of possibilities. Professional designers rely heavily on accessories to bring that special designer’s touch to our projects.
