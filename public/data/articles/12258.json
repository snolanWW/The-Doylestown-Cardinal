While driving, they read a book and talk about how to improve their relationship and family, friends and business. Last summer, they made a stop at Lake Galena and walked to the old wooden pier early in the morning. Richard got down on one knee (giveaway) and proposed. He didn’t want Jodi to forget his pledge, so he wrote it out and gave it to her.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Kids and pets:</b> 4 wonderful children: Erica, Evan, Cole and Logan, a 5-year-old granddaughter, Brooklyn, and two grand dogs JoJo and Krueger.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Show they’re watching:</b> A great music documentary, and on Sunday the Eagles.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Mutual hobbies:</b> Working out, reading and discussing content, cooking, and usually Richard getting crushed in Scrabble.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Favorite date spot in town:</b> Domani Star</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Valentine’s Day plans:</strong> Richard is planning a mystery date.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Where they’ll travel next:</b> Marco Island, Florida</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Best thing they do for their relationship: </b>They live together, work together and play together, yet give one another space.
