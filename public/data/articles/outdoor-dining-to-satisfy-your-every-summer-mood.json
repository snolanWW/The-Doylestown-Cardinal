  "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><em><strong>By Lauren Heine</strong></em> • The Cardinal Contributing Writer</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">S</span><span class=\"s1\">ummer is here in beautiful Bucks County. And if you’re looking to get out there and add some vitamin D to your dining experience, we’ve got glowing summer dining recommendations.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong><span class=\"s3\">BYOB:</span></strong> Ready to enjoy your favorite bottle in an enchanted courtyard? Yes, please! <span class=\"s4\">Genevieve’s Kitchen </span>in Doylestown and <span class=\"s4\">Vecchia Osteria</span> in Newtown have European-style courtyards without the travel.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong><span class=\"s3\">Water Views:</span></strong> The picturesque Delaware River is in your backyard. Snag a front-row seat on the riverfront at<span class=\"s4\"> Stella </span>of New Hope, <span class=\"s4\">Martine’s RiverHouse Restaurant</span>, and the <span class=\"s4\">Playhouse Deck</span> in New Hope.</p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong><span class=\"s5\">Date Night:</span></strong><span class=\"s6\"> Fairy lights and greenery can transform evening outdoor dining into magic. </span><span class=\"s7\">Nektar Wine Bar’s</span><span class=\"s6\"> patio is nestled in a curtain of trees along Aquetong Creek. A couple’s night out is sure to be lively and fun on the covered terrace and pavilion at </span><span class=\"s7\">La Stalla</span><span class=\"s6\"> in Newtown. And the best kept secret is the secluded and romantic </span><span class=\"s7\">Zoubi</span><span class=\"s6\"> in New Hope.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong><span class=\"s3\">Lunch:</span> </strong>Warm sunshine and weekend plans make al fresco lunch a sought-after option. <span class=\"s4\">The Garden at The Pineville Tavern</span> is a gorgeous greenhouse designed straight out of a magazine. The open and spacious patio at <span class=\"s4\">The Grey Stone</span> in Newtown is surrounded by gardens and green fields like a true country manor.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong><span class=\"s3\">Localvores and People Watching: </span></strong>Sunglasses recommended (wink) for the sport of sidewalk side-eye. Not just some rickety tables on the sidewalk; these are the orchestra pit of people watching. State Street in Doylestown is lined with eateries, but <span class=\"s4\">Paganini’s Ristorante</span> and <span class=\"s4\">Penn Taproom</span> have the most real estate with their brick patios. Equally bustling State Street in Newtown boasts <span class=\"s4\">Rocco’s at The Brick’s</span> open-air patio. See and be seen at <span class=\"s4\">Ferry + Main at Logan Inn</span> and the classic <span class=\"s4\">Havana’s</span> in New Hope.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong><span class=\"s3\">Family Friendly:</span></strong> In search of a laid-back outdoor setting with space for the kids to be kids? Check out the grassy grounds of <span class=\"s4\">Lumberville General Store </span>and the patio at <span class=\"s4\">Plumsteadville Inn</span>. <span class=\"s4\">The Station</span> in Dublin features an expansive patio and a modern food hall to satisfy all your picky eaters.</p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong><span class=\"s3\">Weekend Warrior:</span></strong> The timeless outdoor spaces at <span class=\"s4\">Black Bass Hotel</span> and <span class=\"s4\">Rieglesville Inn</span> are definitely worth the drive. Cross over into Lambertville NJ where <span class=\"s4\">Lambertville Station</span> offers sophisticated canal side tables and <span class=\"s4\">Under the Moon Café</span> has breezy porch seating.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong><span class=\"s3\">Lively Libations with Friends: </span></strong>Gather the gang and head to the stylish patio at <span class=\"s4\">The Garden Bar at Puck</span> in Doylestown for an urban atmosphere. Many local breweries and wineries have dedicated outdoor areas with food trucks, live music, and events. Noteworthy places include <span class=\"s4\">Free Will Brewing</span> in Perkasie, <span class=\"s4\">Bishop Estate Vineyard and Winery</span>, and <span class=\"s4\">Wycombe Vineyards</span>.</p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Lucky for us, there are numerous outdoor dining options in Bucks County. But there are only so many days in the summer season. Get out there and try them all!</span></p>\n",
