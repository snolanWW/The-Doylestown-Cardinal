She’d put a sticker of a baby on it and wrote “Daddy’s Workouts” across the bottom, which would have been ADORABLE if I’d noticed, but I looked right past it and instead spent an hour exercising, which was baffling to her for that full hour and hilarious for both of us when I came upstairs, still entirely clueless.</span></p>\n<p><b>Birth memories: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For our first, my wife worked an entire school day through increasing labor pains and contractions. She felt like something was off in the morning but powered through to the end of the last period. Then, I got a call at 3:30 p.m., just a couple hours into my shift at the library, that her coworker had driven her home and I should probably get home quickly. I found out she was in labor at 3:30 and by 8 p.m. he was born. For number two, she’d scheduled her maternity to start on exactly her due date, a Saturday, and darn if that kid/wife team didn’t hold out until 5 AM on the first day of her maternity leave.</span></p>\n<p><b>Most enjoyable part of this stage of parenthood:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For the thirteen-year-old, it’s watching him try new things in an effort to figure out who he is and who he’s going to be. I feel like we’re overscheduled with all the new school clubs that he’s been doing for his first year in middle school. For the ten-year-old, it’s watching his friendships move past the child-like “everyone is my friend” stage into the place where he’s getting close with kids he’s known for yearx. The kids in his age range are starting to internalize that some people click more than others, and he’s seeking out people with whom he clicks. For both, it’s that they’re always trying out dumb new jokes that they hear or see or read. Nothing’s better than a stupid joke out of your kids’ mouths.</span></p>\n<p><b>Hardest part of this stage: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the teenager: there’s a lot of emotional turmoil that his hormones and social changes are putting him through. For the elementary kid: there’s a lot of emotional turmoil that his hormones and social changes are putting him through. For me: there’s a lot of emotional turmoil that their hormones and social changes are putting me through.</span></p>\n<p><b>How you get through the tough moments: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My wife. A good book. Long walks with our dogs. Sincere apologies to everyone after the tough moment.</span></p>\n<p><b>Something you say to your kids a lot:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It’s a tie between “put away your screens” and “put on your shoes.” I have a dread feeling that those phrases are just mindless sentences that will come out of my mouth for years to come.</span></p>\n<p><b>Activity you really love to do with your kids: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch Avatar: The Last Airbender, read a book to them at the end of the day (they still let me read to them. It’s a miracle!), and play Mario Kart.</span></p>\n<p><b>Funny thing your kids say or do right now: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is so much Gen Z and Gen Alpha slang in our house right now that I can’t even begin to catalog it all. It sure is “funny.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Easiest way you can get teens/preteens to open up: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our kids are actually pretty good at the follow-up to the “fine” we get when we ask about their days, whether that’s because we have a decent relationship or they’ve been Pavloved into knowing we won’t let them get away with that response. If they ever aren’t forthcoming, I can usually follow with “did anyone get in trouble?” or “what was today’s scandal at school?” Almost every kid I’ve ever met loves to tell you about the other kid who got in trouble that day. It usually leads to a talk about what’s going on at their school, how they handle being around those tougher situations, and helps me to know if they’ve been involved with kids that I’d rather they stayed away from.</span></p>\n<p><b>Something you’re looking forward to doing as a family this summer: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We go to Cape May with my mom’s whole family&#8211;nearly 40 people across 4 houses&#8211;on a big vacation every summer, and each year it’s been more fun than the last. Almost all my cousins have kids in a big age range from two to 18, so everyone hangs on the beach during the day, and we often do fun things in the mornings and evenings too. We also visit Rhode Island to see their grandparents on their mom’s side every summer. We stay in a glorified shack on the coast and read books and generally chill. It’s really restorative, especially now that they’re old enough to appreciate downtime. We don’t have to worry about toddlers getting naps in a “cottage” of like, 600 square feet, no ceilings, and seagulls on the tin roof every morning at 5 a.m.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Ryan Greiser</b></h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_19878\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19878\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"/data/media/Ryan-Greiser-with-his-children-and-wife.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-large wp-image-19878\" src=\"/data/media/Ryan-Greiser-with-his-children-and-wife-1024x769.jpg\" alt=\"Ryan Greiser \" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\" srcset=\"/data/media/Ryan-Greiser-with-his-children-and-wife-1024x769.jpg 1024w, /data/media/Ryan-Greiser-with-his-children-and-wife-300x225.jpg 300w, /data/media/Ryan-Greiser-with-his-children-and-wife-768x576.jpg 768w, /data/media/Ryan-Greiser-with-his-children-and-wife-74x55.jpg 74w, /data/media/Ryan-Greiser-with-his-children-and-wife-111x83.jpg 111w, /data/media/Ryan-Greiser-with-his-children-and-wife-215x161.jpg 215w, /data/media/Ryan-Greiser-with-his-children-and-wife-990x743.jpg 990w, /data/media/Ryan-Greiser-with-his-children-and-wife.jpg 1171w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-19878\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ryan Greiser with his children and wife</figcaption></figure>\n<p><b>Profession: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial Advisor at Opulus</span></p>\n<p><b>Resident of:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Doylestown Township</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><b>Children: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hudson, 5; Parker, 3; Dylan, 1</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><b>Age you were when you became a dad: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">32</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><b>Birth memories: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hospital drives with my wife are the most memorable part for me. The urgency and anticipation during those middle-of-the-night drives felt like they were in slow motion. Each birth is a blur, but those drives are vivid. It was a surreal experience.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><b>Most enjoyable part of this stage of parenthood: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seeing the world through their eyes. Their excitement when experiencing something new, whether it’s discovering something in the yard or mastering a new skill, is pure and contagious. It’s incredibly rewarding to watch them grow, learn, and achieve milestones. </span></p>\n<p><b>Hardest part of this stage: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding time for everything. I want to be a present and engaged parent, a supportive husband, and run a successful business. Balancing these responsibilities is challenging. It often feels like there aren’t enough hours in the day to give my best to each role. The constant juggling can be overwhelming, but it’s all worth it for my family.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><b>Dad hack for parenting three kids five and under: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’m still figuring things out and don’t feel like an expert, but one thing I’ve learned is that kids just want your presence. Being there for them, even if it’s just sitting together or listening to them talk about their day, makes a big difference. Consistency and showing up for them is the best “hack” I’ve found.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><b>Something you say to your kids a lot: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I regularly tell my kids that they are smart, strong, brave, and kind. I want to instill confidence and resilience in them. Every day, I try to remind them of these qualities to help them grow up believing in themselves and their abilities. It’s important to me that they know their worth and potential.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><b>Activity you really love to do with your kids: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love our annual vacation to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. We enjoy the beach, riding bikes around town, and spending days by the pool or exploring Harbour Town. On a smaller scale, I love to spend one-on-one time with each kid, doing activities they choose. It could be as simple as getting chocolate croissants at Native Cafe before a haircut or a bike ride at Lake Galena. During these times, I have no phone and no distractions—just uninterrupted time with them. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><b>Funny thing your kids say or do right now: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our two oldest are becoming master negotiators. It’s funny to see them figure out how to get a few more minutes to play or an extra snack. They come up with creative arguments and strategies, and it’s both amusing and impressive to watch their negotiation skills develop.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><b>How you and your wife balance work/childcare/time for yourselves: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We try to delegate responsibilities and stick to routines. My wife does the heavy lifting with the kids Tuesday through Friday so I can focus on work, and I take care of them on Mondays so she can advance her career. We aim for a date night once a month, and we each get our workout time at the Y, where the stay-and-play staff takes care of the kids. It’s been a game-changer for us. We’re not perfect, but we make it work by supporting each other and prioritizing our family’s needs.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><b>Something you’d like to do on Father’s Day: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’d love to start with breakfast with my family, followed by a good workout. Spending time with my family is important, so enjoying a relaxed day with great food and drinks would be perfect. If the weather is nice, visiting Warwick Farms Brewery and enjoying Ardana’s Pizza Truck sounds ideal. It’s a simple day filled with family, fun, and my favorite things.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Corey Hunter</b></h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_19875\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19875\" style=\"width: 585px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"/data/media/Corey-Hunters-daughters-and-grandchildren-in-top-photo-with-their-mom-and-Corey-and-his-son-in-bottom-photo.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-large wp-image-19875\" src=\"/data/media/Corey-Hunters-daughters-and-grandchildren-in-top-photo-with-their-mom-and-Corey-and-his-son-in-bottom-photo-585x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Corey Hunter\" width=\"585\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"/data/media/Corey-Hunters-daughters-and-grandchildren-in-top-photo-with-their-mom-and-Corey-and-his-son-in-bottom-photo-585x1024.jpg 585w, /data/media/Corey-Hunters-daughters-and-grandchildren-in-top-photo-with-their-mom-and-Corey-and-his-son-in-bottom-photo-171x300.jpg 171w, /data/media/Corey-Hunters-daughters-and-grandchildren-in-top-photo-with-their-mom-and-Corey-and-his-son-in-bottom-photo-768x1344.jpg 768w, /data/media/Corey-Hunters-daughters-and-grandchildren-in-top-photo-with-their-mom-and-Corey-and-his-son-in-bottom-photo-990x1732.jpg 990w, /data/media/Corey-Hunters-daughters-and-grandchildren-in-top-photo-with-their-mom-and-Corey-and-his-son-in-bottom-photo.jpg 1079w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-19875\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Corey Hunter&#8217;s daughters and grandchildren in top photo, with their mom, and Corey and his son in bottom photo</figcaption></figure>\n<p><b>Profession:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Social Services Children and Youth Bucks County</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><b>Resident of:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Doylestown Borough</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><b>Children:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Raquel (Rockey), 35; Corryn, 30; Corey, 17</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><b>Age when you became a dad:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I was 17 years old in 1988 when I became a dad.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><b>Best advice you’ve gotten about fatherhood:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Always be there for your children.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><b>What you’re most proud of:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I am most proud that my children have all done far better than I have at every stage of their young adult lives, especially throughout school.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><b>Most enjoyable part of this stage of parenthood:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I enjoy having heart-to-heart conversations about life and advising them when they call.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><b>Memories from the early years:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I remember doing my daughters’ hair and when they all first started school.

In my anxious state, it reminded me of the Goethe poem about a father hastily carrying his child on horseback as the Elf King rides in pursuit trying to drag the child to the netherworld. I also remember how dramatic it felt when Molly was born, being back in the same hospital as with Charlie but this time at night and with a skeleton crew because of the Covid lockdown.</span></p>\n<p><b>Most enjoyable part of this stage of parenthood:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Watching their beautiful faces light up at things I’ve become jaded to.</span></p>\n<p><b>Hardest part of this stage:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The fear that they’ll become overly ideological and lose their receptivity to beauty and moral ambiguity in art and other human interactions.</span></p>\n<p><b>Something you say to your kids a lot:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> “Focus.” (when they’re climbing)</span></p>\n<p><b>Local activity you really love to do with your kids:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I like to put them in bike seats and ride to neighboring towns, maybe go to The Starving Artist Cafe in Stockton, or dip our toes in a creek.</span></p>\n<p><b>Funny thing your kids say or do right now:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I’ll ask Molly what Power Droid says (He’s a minor character from Star Wars) and she’ll reply, “Gonk Gonk”. She says the same thing for horses and cows. Also, this was a while ago, but I was once changing Charlie’s diaper on the seat of a picnic table and she said, “Papa, it’s too precarious.”</span></p>\n<p><b>A proud dad moment:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Any time either of them proactively makes conversation with a stranger and looks them in the eye …or the time one-year-old Molly climbed up a six-foot rope ladder on her own …or maybe today when Charlie comforted her mom (who is a therapist) saying, “It’s okay you can take some time to yourself and breathe.”</span></p>\n<p><b>How you involve your kids in art or music-making:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I had them make miniature drawings/paintings to decorate the interior of their Barbie castle to get them to think of visual art in terms of how it interacts with its physical surroundings. I had my older daughter do a cultish chant in a song I was recording but I didn’t use it because it sounded hexed and too unsettling.</span></p>\n<p><b>Something you’re looking forward to doing as a family this summer:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Going to the seafood deli on Cape Cod where you can watch the seals hang out as the fishermen unload their catch.</span></p>\n<p><b>One thing you’d like to do on Father’s Day:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Family night at The Boat House bar (I don’t think that’s actually a thing).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
