It’s also a time of change. Our weather is starting to feel a little cooler, and the early leaves will start falling and turning colors.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong><span class=\"s3\">September and the seasonal changes inspire us to change our home environment as well.</span></strong><span class=\"s1\"> Our activities will soon transfer from outdoors to inside. Thoughts start to wander to evenings in front of a fire and curling up under warm, cuddly throws. Suddenly we might crave deeper, richer colors in our surroundings or warmer textures. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Luckily, the current decorating trends are providing us with lots of beautiful and comfortable options to enjoy our interior spaces this Fall, and the best news is that they don’t require major change or expense. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong>Easy Fall Decorating Tip: Incorporate soft, chunky textures with accessories</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><i>“If you’ve started thinking about bringing out your soft fall sweaters, think about giving your house some sweaters too.”</i><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Yes, you read that right. It’s a hot decorating trend this Fall that’s a very easy and relatively inexpensive way to update your home and outfit it for the Fall season. Many vendors have come out with chunky knit pillows that look like they were made from cable sweaters. Try some for your sofa or bed. Consider flannel pillows or pillows made from old rugs for a textural treat. Some throws are made with massively chunky yarn that’s inches thick. There’s something very comforting and irresistible about curling up under that kind of texture. Adding faux fur pillows or throws will make you feel toasty on chilly nights and will delight your sense of touch. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">This creates something you may have read about recently called “hygge”, and it’s just what we want and need right now.</span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_11250\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-11250\" style=\"width: 1388px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"/data/media/02-DSC_8633-Edit.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-11250\" src=\"/data/media/02-DSC_8633-Edit.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1388\" height=\"2080\" srcset=\"/data/media/02-DSC_8633-Edit.jpg 1388w, /data/media/02-DSC_8633-Edit-200x300.jpg 200w, /data/media/02-DSC_8633-Edit-768x1151.jpg 768w, /data/media/02-DSC_8633-Edit-683x1024.jpg 683w, /data/media/02-DSC_8633-Edit-990x1484.jpg 990w, /data/media/02-DSC_8633-Edit-1320x1978.jpg 1320w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1388px) 100vw, 1388px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-11250\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo by Maxwell Luke Photography</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong>“Hygge” is a Scandinavian word describing a mood of coziness and comfort that prompts feelings of wellness and contentment.</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Even your rugs can inject softness and texture. You can find rugs that look knitted like a giant sweater. Many of them come in soft ivory tones and are beautiful in neutral living rooms and bedrooms. Imagine getting out of bed on a cool morning and having your feet land on a soft, warm sweater texture. You can also consider deep, soft shag area rugs that your bare feet can sink into.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s4\">Many shag rugs have sculpted surfaces. Another tip: Try layering rugs. Faded vintage-style rugs look great layered on top of sisal rugs, as shown in the photo. If you like decorating with neutrals, you’ll appreciate the rich dimension that these textures can provide your space.</span><strong><span class=\"s5\"> Textures are a great way to keep a neutral scheme from looking bland, and they really boost hygge.</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">If you’d like some inspiration for adding hygge to your home, check out this link to a curated collection of accessories: <a href=\"https://stagecoachservices.com/home-shop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://stagecoachservices.com/home-shop</a></span></p>\n<p class=\"p9\"><strong>Interior design in photos: StageCoachServices.com</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p10\"><span class=\"s6\"><i>Victoria Guillot is a home stager/interior designer of 15 years based in Buckingham/Doylestown.
