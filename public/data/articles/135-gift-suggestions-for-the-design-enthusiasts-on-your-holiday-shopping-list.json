If you’re one of those well-organized people who already has their holiday shopping completed, I admire you. It seems I’m always behind the eight ball when it comes to gift gathering.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">This year, however, I decided to start a little earlier. As most people are now aware, the supply chain issues and labor shortages could cause significant delays in receiving items, so I got organized for a change. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">If you are still looking for some special and unique gifts, look no further. I’ve done the work for you. I spent hours searching for unusual items from stocking stuffers to luxury items. I searched a very wide price range to accommodate any budget and a broad gamut of taste. Below is a link to 135 delightful gift options sure to please the most discriminating people on your list.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">For people whose decorating taste is unknown or for a high-end stocking stuffer, consider giving a little luxury item that has been enjoyed by kings for centuries and continues to be made by the same company to this day. I’m talking about scented candles from the 17th century company now known as Royal Wax Manufacturer.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>This company was the official supplier to the French court, then to Napoléon Bonaparte. It was also the recipient of the Gold Medal from the 1889 Universal Exhibit for its outstanding quality of candles and wax. Choose from travel size to larger options. I figure if it was enjoyed by Napoleon and Louis XVIII, it’s likely to please my friends too. And isn’t it fun to be able to tell that royal story?</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s4\">Perhaps your gift is for someone who values experiences over decor. How about a mini personal firepit that’s safe for inside the home and that can provide the ambience only a flickering fire can deliver. Because it’s safe to cook over, there can be memories of evenings making s’mores with it! <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">If you know the decorating taste of the recipient, consider offering accessories that add that finishing touch or an extra layer of comfort to their décor. After all, comfort and feathering our nests has become a huge priority for everyone since the Pandemic started.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">I’ve gathered suggestions for vases, pillows, poufs, fire screens, desk décor, throws, statues, lanterns, decorative storage pieces and books in such a range of styles you’re sure to find something to delight the lucky people on your list.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">Have you included yourself on your gift list??? As I was sifting through the many options, I found myself wishing many of them would show up under my tree this year. (Hint, hint, hubby.)</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">For these gift images shown and many, many more, here’s a link to the collection I’ve curated for you with special designer trade access to stunning and unusual items.
