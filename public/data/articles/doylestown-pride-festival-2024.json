The group hosted the first Doylestown Pride Festival in June 2019, on the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Riots. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coming out of the pandemic we found new ways to grow and share memorable events with the community. Funds raised through sponsorship and ticket sales of the events helped us fund the initial painting and ongoing maintenance of the rainbow crosswalk in 2023. We’re proud to say that our rainbow crosswalk was the first in Bucks County.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information about events and volunteer opportunities, visit <a href=\"https://www.dtownpride.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DtownPride.com</a>.  </span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_19828\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19828\" style=\"width: 940px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"/data/media/Colorful-Gradient-Pride-Month-Instagram-Post.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-19828\" src=\"/data/media/Colorful-Gradient-Pride-Month-Instagram-Post.png\" alt=\"Doylestown Pride Fest \" width=\"940\" height=\"788\" srcset=\"/data/media/Colorful-Gradient-Pride-Month-Instagram-Post.png 940w, /data/media/Colorful-Gradient-Pride-Month-Instagram-Post-300x251.png 300w, /data/media/Colorful-Gradient-Pride-Month-Instagram-Post-768x644.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-19828\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Doylestown Pride Fest Schedule</figcaption></figure>\n",
