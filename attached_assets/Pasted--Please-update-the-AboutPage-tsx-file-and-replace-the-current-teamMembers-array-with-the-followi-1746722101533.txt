“Please update the `AboutPage.tsx` file and replace the current `teamMembers` array with the following bios from the `Writers Bios.eml` file. Each team member object should include the following properties: `name`, `role`, `bio`, and you can use a placeholder image (`https://via.placeholder.com/150`) for the `image` property for now.

Here’s the new `teamMembers` array to include:

```js
const teamMembers = [
  {
    name: 'Jay Pelc',
    role: 'Sales',
    bio: 'Jay Pelc, a Brooklyn native, moved to Jim Thorpe in 2019. For the past 32 years, he has had great success in selling mostly print advertising in both small and large markets. He now serves in that capacity for both The Jim Thorpe Current and The Doylestown Cardinal.',

  },
  {
    name: 'Ellen',
    role: 'Sales',
    bio: 'Ellen is a former New Yorker who has been living in Doylestown for many years. She brings extensive experience in sales and community outreach, helping connect local businesses with The Cardinal’s readers.',

  {

```

### ✅ **Additional Instructions**
