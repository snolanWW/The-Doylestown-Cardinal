“Please update the `AboutPage.tsx` file and fully redesign the **‘Meet Our Team’** section to include all the following team members. Use the images from the `/public/images/Staff` folder as specified below.

Each team member object should have:

* `name` → string
* `role` → string
* `bio` → string
* `image` → relative path (example: `/images/Staff/Jay-Pelc.jpeg`)

### ✅ UI Update Instructions

* Use the existing card or grid layout, but **adjust the CSS or component props** to allow 2–3 members per row on desktop and 1 per row on mobile.
* Ensure each card shows:

  * Circular or square image.
  * Name.
  * Role.
  * Short bio.
* Consider adding a **scrolling carousel** or **expand/collapse bio** on mobile to improve usability if space is tight.
* Keep consistency with typography, button styles, and responsiveness already set on the About page.

---

### ⚙️ Notes

* Leave the **Recognition & Awards** and **Where to Find Our Print Edition** sections unchanged.
* Make sure the team section is easily maintainable, e.g., the developer can add new members by pushing to the `teamMembers` array.
