## &#x20;Redesign `/donate` Page into a New `/support-us` Landing Page

### 🎯 Goal

Redesign the current `/donate` page into a focused and visually streamlined **Support Us** landing page, and **update the routing** so the page lives at:

```
/support-us
```

---

### 🧩 Page Structure

#### 1. **Hero Section**

* Title: `Support The Cardinal`
* Subtitle: *“Help us continue delivering meaningful, independent journalism to the Doylestown community.”*
* Primary CTA buttons:

  * “Donate Now” → `/donate-options`
  * “Subscribe” → `/digital-subscriptions`

#### 2. **Support Options Grid (3 cards or columns)**

Each with a short description and button:

* ✅ **Digital Access**

  * “Unlimited articles, mobile access, digital archive”
  * Button: “View Plans” → `/digital-subscriptions`

* ✅ **Print Subscription**

  * “Weekly print delivery with full digital access”
  * Button: “Subscribe” → `/print-subscriptions`

* ✅ **Make a Donation**

  * “One-time or monthly gifts to support our mission”
  * Button: “Donate” → `/donate-options`

#### 3. **Corporate Sponsorship Section (Optional)**

* One-paragraph overview:
  *“Are you a local business looking to support independent journalism while connecting with our readers? Explore corporate sponsorship opportunities.”*
* Button: “Learn More” → `/donate-options#corporate`

#### 4. **(Optional) Reader Impact Metrics**

* Add an optional block showing:

  * Monthly readers
  * Articles published
  * Years in operation
  * Community partnerships

### 🔧 Technical Requirements

1. **Create a new route and component**:

   * Route: `/support-us`
   * Component: `SupportUsPage.tsx` (or `SupportLandingPage.tsx`)

2. **Remove or deprecate ****`/donate`**** route**

   * Redirect `/donate` to `/support-us`
   * OR update the router to point to the new component

3. **Ensure buttons and navigation links across the site point to ****`/support-us`**** going forward**

### ✅ Outcome

* A modern, clean `/support-us` landing page
* Consolidates all support pathways into one clear user experience
* Replaces `/donate` with a more intuitive, action-oriented route
