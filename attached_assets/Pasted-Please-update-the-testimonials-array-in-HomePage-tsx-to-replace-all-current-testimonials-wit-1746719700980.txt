Please update the `testimonials` array in `HomePage.tsx` to **replace all current testimonials** with the following real community quotes. Remove the `image` property from the testimonial objects — only include `quote`, `author`, and `role`. The existing carousel will display the quotes and author info without images.”

✅ **Final Notes for Developer:**

* Remove all current testimonial objects from the array.
* Remove the `image` property entirely from each testimonial.
* Ensure the slider works smoothly without the image (you may want to hide or adjust the `img` tag and author avatar in the JSX).
