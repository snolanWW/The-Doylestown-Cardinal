Thanks for sharing the updated `ArticlesPage.tsx`. The component logic looks correct **assuming** `/data/articles.json` is accessible. However, based on the error message in your screenshot ("**Failed to load articles.**"), it's likely that the request to `/data/articles.json` is failing at runtime.

## üîç Diagnosis Checklist

Let's go through the top causes:

### ‚úÖ 1. **Check the file location**

Ensure that `articles.json` is located here:

```
/data/articles.json
```

This file must be publicly accessible, so it should **not** be inside `src/data/` or anywhere else outside `/public`.

### ‚úÖ 2. **Confirm correct fetch path**

Your fetch code uses:

```ts
const response = await fetch('/data/articles.json');
```

Which translates to:

```
https://<your-replit-site>.replit.dev/data/articles.json
```

‚û°Ô∏è Open that path directly in the browser. If it throws a 404 or server error, the file isn‚Äôt accessible where it needs to be.

### ‚úÖ 3. **Check Replit behavior**

On Replit, `public/` is used to serve static assets. Any files inside `public/data/` should be reachable by `fetch('/data/filename.json')`.

If it‚Äôs still failing:

* Restart the Replit server.
* Make sure the file isn't being ignored or locked.
* Rename the file to lowercase (`articles.json`) if needed (case-sensitive paths).

## ‚úÖ Solution Summary

If the file is correct but still not working, try this:

1. **Move ********`articles.json`******** to**:

   ```
   /data/articles.json
   ```

2. **Verify it‚Äôs accessible** in your browser:

   ```
   https://your-project.replit.dev/data/articles.json
   ```

3. **Check console in DevTools** (Network tab) to confirm the fetch isn't returning 404, CORS, or permission errors.

## üß™ Next Step: Confirm Accessibility

Please try opening `/data/articles.json` directly in your browser and let me know:

* Does the file load?
* If not, what's the HTTP status code or message?

If you're still stuck, I can walk you through how to regenerate the file cleanly and ensure it's served properly.
