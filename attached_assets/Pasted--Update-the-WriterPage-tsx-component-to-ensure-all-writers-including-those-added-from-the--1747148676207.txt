> Update the `WriterPage.tsx` component to ensure **all writers**, including those added from the `/about` page (e.g., Dakoda, Servis Events, Brian, Edie Weinstein), properly populate their **bio**, **image**, **name**, and **role** on the `/writer/:id` page.
>
> ### Current Issue:
>
> When clicking on one of the new writers from `/writers`, the app routes correctly to `/writer/:id`, but the page returns **"Writer not found"** and shows no content.
>
> ### Goal:
>
> Display the writer's full bio and information just like Leia Riggins’ profile page (image, name, tags, and paragraph bio).
>
> ---
>
> ### What to check and fix:
>
> ✅ **1. Centralized writer data file**
>
> * Make sure all writers (old and new) are listed in the file used to drive `WriterPage.tsx`.
> * This might be something like:
>
>   ```ts
>   export const writers = [
>     {
>       id: "leia-riggins",
>       name: "Leia Riggins",
>       image: "/images/writers/leia.jpg",
>       role: "Writer",
>       tags: ["Mental Health", "Wellness", "Community Support"],
>       bio: "...",
>     },
>     {
>       id: "dakoda",
>       name: "Dakoda",
>       role: "Social Media Manager",
>       image: "...",
>       tags: ["Community Coverage", "Events"],
>       bio: "Dakoda is a local writer passionate about covering events...",
>     },
>     // Add all remaining writers here
>   ]
>   ```
>
> ✅ **2. Match the writer ****`id`**** from the URL**
>
> * The `WriterPage.tsx` component should:
>
>   * Use `useParams()` to get the `:id`.
>   * Look up the correct writer using `writers.find(w => w.id === id)`.
>   * Render the card using the same structure as Leia Riggins.
>
> ✅ **3. Add fallback content**
>
> * If a writer is not found, show `"Writer not found"` gracefully with a link back to `/writers`.
>
> ---
>
> ### Outcome:
>
> * All new writers show full profiles when clicked.
> * Each writer page matches the design and layout used for existing profiles.
> * No missing content or “not found” errors unless the ID truly doesn’t exist.
