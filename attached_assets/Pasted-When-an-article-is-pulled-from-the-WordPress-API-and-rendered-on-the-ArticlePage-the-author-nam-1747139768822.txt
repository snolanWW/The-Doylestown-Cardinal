When an article is pulled from the WordPress API and rendered on the `ArticlePage`, the **author name should link to their full bio** on `/writer/:id`, using the existing writer data already defined locally.

---

### ‚úÖ Implementation Steps

---

#### 1. **Create a central ****`writerDirectory.ts`**** mapping file**

This file maps **WordPress author names** to your local `writerId` values (used in URL slugs):

```ts
export const writerDirectory: Record<string, string> = {
  "Natalya Bucuy": "natalya-bucuy",
  "Leia Riggins": "leia-riggins",
  "Annika Verma": "annika-verma",
  // Add more as needed
};
```

Save it in:
`src/data/writerDirectory.ts`

---

#### 2. \*\*Update \*\***`ArticlePage.tsx`**

Inside your component, **import the mapping** and use it to generate author profile links.

Add to the top:

```tsx
import { writerDirectory } from "../data/writerDirectory";
```

Replace the author line:

```tsx
<span>{article.author}</span>
```

With:

```tsx
{writerDirectory[article.author] ? (
  <Link
    to={`/writer/${writerDirectory[article.author]}`}
    className="text-cardinal-red hover:text-forest-green font-semibold"
  >
    {article.author}
  </Link>
) : (
  <span>{article.author}</span>
)}
```

---

#### 3. **Verify routes and slugs**

Your `WriterPage.tsx` is already wired to use `/writer/:writerId`, and slugs like `"natalya-bucuy"` are already being used.

‚úÖ That means the links will route correctly.

---

#### 4. **Test fallback handling**

If a new author writes a post and they‚Äôre not in `writerDirectory`, it will render their name as plain text ‚Äî no broken links.

‚úÖ Optional: Log a warning in dev mode so you remember to add them to the directory.

---

### üß© Optional Enhancements

* Show the **writer‚Äôs profile image and role** below the article.
* Add a ‚ÄúMore from this writer‚Äù section below the article content.
