With the plethora of products on the market claiming they are clean and green, how can one figure out the best options to choose? Remember that many skin and body care products contain numerous ingredients (chemicals) in them that are endocrine disruptors, carcinogens, allergens, and irritants. Taking steps in making healthier choices starts now for a healthier you and in your future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some helpful resources for anyone looking to reduce chemical exposure to their skin, body, and makeup use.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let’s start with </span><b>EWG (Environmental Working Group)</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a nonprofit nonpartisan organization dedicated to helping people live healthier lives. The company truly set the gold standard in clean ratings above all others. It ranks products from one to 10 (one best, 10 worst) for those containing hazardous ingredients that could negatively impact our health. On its website, you can look up products by name, type, and barcode to search the safety database and ratings. EWG gives very detailed information on each product reviewed and tested.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next is the app called </span><b>YUKA</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which examines product labels and analyzes the health impact of various food items and cosmetics. You simply download the app and scan the barcode with your smartphone for safety data. Yuka vows “no influence from brands to influence scoring, no ads allowed or advertising on their site, and no conflicts of interest with financing their organization.” This app rates ingredients on a scale of low risk to hazardous. If a product scores poorly, YUKA suggests a healthier alternative for consumers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding the right clean products can get a bit overwhelming. I know, I’ve been there. Start by taking steps to try just one new clean product at a time. See how it compares with what you already have been using. Does it work the same? Then why not make the healthier switch? If it’s not as good, then keep trying new clean options until you find your best swap. I’m going to save you time and money by listing here my personally tried and true clean favorite products and brands. Also, begin first by swapping out a product that you use a lot in order to maximize the overall reduction of chemicals you are exposed to daily. Your body will absolutely thank you!</span></p>\n<p><b>Jill’s Favorite Clean Swaps:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Many listed are organic and EWG Verified:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Attitude brand products and lip balm, Babo Botanicals soap/skin/sunscreen, Honest Beauty skin, body, and makeup, Henry Rose perfume, Bare Minerals makeup, Tom’s deodorant, David’s toothpaste, Biossence sunscreen and lip balm, Innersense hair care products, Eminence Organic coconut moisturizer, Alba UNpetroleum jelly, Acure brand skincare, Mad Hippie skin care, Avalon Organics shampoo/conditioner, Dr. Bronner’s soap.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additional recommendations based on EWG best ratings: Honest flushable wipes, Each &amp; Every body wash, Kinfield face and body, Crunch makeup, Lowen’s skin care, Baja Baby.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
