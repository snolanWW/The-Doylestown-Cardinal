This Holicong-based non-profit organization takes great pride in “making a difference, one bite at a time.”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What are Bake Ability’s key ingredients?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">Paula Fasciano, the owner, opened this brick-and-mortar bakery in February of 2021 to provide employment opportunities for her sons, Matthew and Benjamin, who were both diagnosed at an early age with Fragile X Syndrome. Her sons are now 26 and 20. “A bunch of moms like myself with children over the age of 21 with developmental disabilities were struggling to help our children secure jobs,” Fasciano recalls. “So a lightbulb went off in my head!”</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s4\">Located in the Buckingham Green Shopping Center, the bakery’s 19 employees on staff are supported by their parents and several community volunteers. Not only do they have meaningful employment, but they learn about baking, holding a job, and honing professional skills that could transfer to other businesses someday. “We look at ourselves as a training ground. It just so happens we’re a bakery,” Fasciano says.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">In the short time Bake Ability has been open, a loyal customer base has grown to love the delectable confections the bakery produces. And there are no plans of slowing down. Fasciano would love to open another location to expand operations. She hopes to collaborate with other non-profits and dreams of contracting with school districts, restaurants, or other businesses.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">As the revenue continues to grow, the organization may someday be able to hire a full-time job coach so the employees can learn to work with people who aren’t their parents for even greater independence.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">Fasciano is also working toward the goal of creating a residential community where young adults can live and work.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_17925\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-17925\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Caitlyn-Flip-Flops-061023.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-large wp-image-17925\" src=\"https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Caitlyn-Flip-Flops-061023-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Caitlyn-Flip-Flops-061023-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Caitlyn-Flip-Flops-061023-225x300.jpg 225w, https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Caitlyn-Flip-Flops-061023-990x1320.jpg 990w, https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Caitlyn-Flip-Flops-061023.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-17925\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Caitlin decorating iced cookies</figcaption></figure>\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">What are their recipes for success?</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">Denise Campbell, store manager, works a couple of days a week as head of marketing and public relations for the bakery, also supporting her daughter Erin’s employment. “Everything here is delicious,” Campbell says. “Everything is made on the premises with natural ingredients.” She highly recommends her own favorite treat &#8211; the chocolate buttercream marble brownies.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">At the bakery, patrons can sample the savory bites, like the breakfast pizzette or cheddar cheese scone, or for sweet tooths, try the snickerdoodles, lemon bars, or peanut butter shortbread. This inclusive business has created something for everyone.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">Bake Ability’s recipes come from many sources, some of which are a compilation of family recipes. Fasciano boasts, “Our treats are absolutely freaking delicious! Each is more delicious than the next.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><strong><span class=\"s1\">How can we support Bake Ability?<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s5\">Stop by the store at 4950 York in Holicong or place a catering order in advance by phone.
