Look no further than Danielle Gannon’s boutique marketing agency, Local Spotlight With Danielle. Gannon’s company offers website design, public relations, social media assistance, and event planning. The agency serves a variety of local businesses, groups, and individuals looking to promote their services or increase community awareness.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">“Local Spotlight With Danielle” likely sounds familiar to readers, as Gannon has a monthly feature in this paper. In it, she highlights local businesses and entrepreneurs. Gannon also runs a well-known Instagram account. There, she features local businesses, groups, and individuals, sometimes in conversation with her in a brief video interview.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Gannon started Local Spotlights in 2018. Then, it was based out of her business, Organnons Natural Market, located in The Shops at Carousel Village (formerly, the Shoppes at Wrightstown). Gannon began featuring the local vendors who sold their goods in the market, via short video interviews.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">This was before short-form videos exploded into popularity, and Gannon’s vendors put the videos on their websites and on the Organnons’ website. Gannon found these interviews and videos to be a great way to cross-market her vendors and the store, and also realized that it sparked a light in her that she wanted to keep aglow.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Gannon’s career path led her down a long road. She got her degree at Penn State in Journalism and PR, subsequently interning at radio stations 95.7 and Q102 and doing voiceovers. She lived in Las Vegas between 2003 and 2007. There, she became part-owner of a black car service and got experience in sales and marketing. She followed that career for the majority of her 20s and 30s.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">After moving back to Pennsylvania in 2008, she became the Director of Communications and eventually the Manager of Internet Sales for Sunrise Senior Living. In 2013, Gannon co-opened the cleverly named Organnons Natural Market, where the “Local Spotlight,” was born.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">In the year 2020, the year of change and transition for many, Gannon ventured on her own. Local Spotlight featured businesses across Bucks County. She loved telling small businesses’ stories, connecting consumers to the business owners on true, personal levels. Slowly but surely, Gannon’s business grew.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Gannon managed social media pages for a variety of businesses, and her monthly column in your local newspaper <i>The Doylestown Cardinal</i>. She has aggregated her years of experience and passion for promoting local businesses for the community’s benefit into her new venture, her own agency. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Gannon has a strong sense of self. She says she was never certain how she would monetize her growing passion, but knew following her instincts would lead her exactly where she needed to go. She has a unique ability to interconnect businesses where she finds it makes sense. She excels at spreading brand awareness and cross-marketing via social media.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Gannon has many accounts in Bucks County and has recently crossed into Hunterdon County. Her clients consistently report that they are very comfortable with her and feel an immediate, natural connection.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Gannon, who is as warm, engaging, and beautiful in person as she is on her Instagram videos and photos, makes sure that she and her clients align well. She is an open, curious, and nonjudgmental person, and truly loves to learn about people and their unique stories.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Gannon is an Ivyland-based busy mom of three &#8211; 13-year-old Abbey, 11-year-old Gabe, and 7-year-old Sebastian.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Interested businesses, groups, or individuals can reach out directly to Gannon about her services at 267-980-2176 or <a href=\"mailto:localspotlightwithdanielle@gmail.com\">localspotlightwithdanielle@gmail.com</a>.
