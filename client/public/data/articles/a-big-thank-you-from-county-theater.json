Thanks to your contributions, we not only met, but exceeded, our 2021 Recovery Fund goal.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">These vital funds allow the County Theater to continue to navigate the impacts of the pandemic and help secure our future. They also support the programming that makes the County more than just a movie theater — a diverse mix of independent, art house, and foreign films as well as curated programs, discussions, and special events. Plus, the funds paid for the a new roof on the historic theater – the first since 1938.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Your support is the foundation that keeps the County Theater a cornerstone of our town.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>THANK YOU.</b></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">John Toner, Founding Director</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">On behalf of the County Theater Board of Directors and the Expansion Co-Chairs, Pam Byers, Mark Dibner, and Dick Patterson</p>\n",
