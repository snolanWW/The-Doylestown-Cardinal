A stunning hotel and restaurant tucked quietly off of downtown New Hope’s main street, this waterfront establishment was just voted #1 World’s Best Resort Hotel in the Mid-Atlantic by Travel and Leisure. My husband and I did a midweek staycation there last year and it was absolutely divine. Our room was straight out of a design magazine, complete with our own personal balcony where we watched the rapids on the Delaware, sipped wine, chatted, and read books.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">A floor below, Odette’s Restaurant has an outdoor wrap-around porch where you can order from their seasonal menu or take your cocktails over to the adjacent Piano Lounge which has live entertainment, seven nights a week. My favorite perk about staying at the River House is that hotel guests have access to their exclusive members-only rooftop club. We popped up there after a night of hitting up some local New Hope haunts and were greeted by a roaring outdoor fireplace, a 1970’s inspired bar and lounge, specialty drinks, and views for miles. The Resort just launched new package deals with local establishments such as “A Stay and Show” which includes tickets to a performance at the iconic Bucks County Playhouse and a $50 dining credit each day, a “Crossing Vineyards Excursion” which includes a wine tasting at Crossing Vineyards, a bottle of wine and a wine lover’s picnic basket, as well as a family package with tickets for all to the local Children’s Museum. Be sure to check out the website and join their mailing list for updates on reduced room rates, special events, and other packages.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">River House at Odette’s • 274 S River Road,<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>New Hope</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><a href=\"http://Riverhousenewhope.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s1\">Riverhousenewhope.com</span></a></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong>A WIZARDING AUGUST<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Confession: I was almost 40 years old and had never read a Harry Potter book or even seen one of the famous flicks. My then four-year-old son pulled out a paperback copy of Sorcerer’s Stone while shopping one day and we decided to give it a go. A few chapters in, we were hooked. Here we are, almost three years later, and we are on Book Five together and loving every page.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s3\">So you can only imagine our excitement when we heard about the Cloak and Wand shop that opened in Peddler’s Village. Whether you like Harry Potter, Hocus Pocus, Fantasia or even just looking for some standard wizarding apparel or a custom wand, this shop is most definitely worth a pop-in. The elaborate “Potions Bar” is a custom hot chocolate and soda bar made up of over 64 enchanting flavors and toppings like Wizard Beer, Griffin Whipped Cream, or Fairy Dust. Here, aspiring wizards can mix and match to create their tasty potions. And be sure to gather up all your Harry Potter fans and travel via Floo Powder (or car) to the outdoor screening of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone on the lawn of the Mercer Museum on Thursday, Aug 17. Don’t forget a chair, blanket, snacks, and your wizarding wand, of course.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Movies at the Mercer</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Gates open at 7:15, movie starts at dusk around 8:15 • 84 South Pine St, Doylestown</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><a href=\"http://Mercermuseum.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s1\">Mercermuseum.org</span></a></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong>SUNFLOWERS AND FARM FUN</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We discovered Hellerick’s Farm a few fall festivals ago and fell in love with the fields of playgrounds made from farm machinery and materials. You’ll find over 40 attractions across 18 picturesque acres all included in the price of admission. Some of our favorites are the side-by-side corn chute slides, a basketball shoot-out made from a grain wagon, an Amish scooter track, a tractor pull, a tire playground, tons of farm animals, hourly hayrides, and in the Fall, the corn maze is not to be missed.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">For an additional fee, you can test your agility at their Aerial Adventure Park which has 9 zip lines, 21 crossing elements, and even a 30-foot free fall leap. Even if heights aren’t your thing, be sure to stop by the farm from Aug. 15<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>on for the annual Sunflower Days, where you can pick your own and pose amongst these majestic beauties for some stunning photo ops (Sunflower Days included in the price of admission).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Daily admission is $14.99 per person (2 and under are free), but if you buy a season pass for $49.99 per person, you get access to all summer festivities as well as all of the fall fun through Nov 26, which in my opinion is a pretty “farmtastic” deal.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Hellerick’s Family Farm • 5500 N. Easton Road, Doylestown</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Visit <a href=\"http://hellericksfarm.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hellericksfarm.com</a> for more info and a schedule of events<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong>LANTERNS ABLAZE</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you’re looking for a fun little day trip (or in this case, night trip might be better), hop in the car and head over to the Chinese Lantern Festival at Franklin Square in Philadelphia. The festival is running now through August 13th and is filled with 34 installations, 180 animals, 2,500 flowers and 25,000 LEDs, a star trail that is activated by your footsteps, and the coolest bubble machine that makes dry ice floating bubbles that magically dissolve on your hand. There are three cultural performances every night with some of the most incredible talent. New lanterns featured this year include the 100-foot-long Sea Dragon Tunnel, a Year of the Rabbit display, the interactive Fortune Telling Wall, Panda-monium and many more.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">And if you want to make a weekend of it, there is plenty to do in and around the Festival. Franklin Square is home to the Parx Liberty Carousel, a<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Philly-themed mini-golf course, choreographed, illuminated water shows at the Franklin Square Fountain, and family-friendly playgrounds. (Note that additional tickets are required for the carousel and golf.) Just up the block from the Festival is the Museum of Illusions which allows visitors to become part of themind-bending images and the Museum of the American Revolution which has Washington’s real tent on display and an amazing kid’s section if you bring the littles. Across the street from museum is Jose Garces’ Amada and if you get there early enough, be sure to catch their happy hour which has special menu items that can only be purchased during happy hour (the “Cojonudo’ with sobrassada sausage and a fried quail egg for $5 is my fave). End your evening with a walk along the waterfront or stop in for some old-fashioned ice cream at Franklin Fountain on your way home from your weekend of Philly fun.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Philadelphia Chinese Lantern Festival</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Franklin Square, 200 N. 6th Street, Philadelphia, PA</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Buy tickets and find out more info at <a href=\"http://phillychineselanternfestival.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">phillychineselanternfestival.com</a></span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong>“RACE” YOUR GLASS<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">What do you get when you combine the love of running with the love of wine? The Bishop Estate unWINEd 5K Vineyard Run &amp; Kids Grape Juice Run, of course! Bishop Estate is one of my favorite local wineries—the wines are delicious, the grounds are breathtaking, and they always have awesome events planned, like a wine run. And on Wednesday, Aug. 23, you can run a 5K through the vineyards at sunset, hang out after for live music, food trucks, lawn games, and even partake in a complimentary wine tasting (21 plus). Sign up today at <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/bishoprun\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://tinyurl.com/bishoprun</a> and check out bishopestatepa.com to find out about other upcoming events and specials.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Bishop Estate Vineyard &amp; Winery • 2730 Hilltown Pike, Perkasie</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><strong>BEYOND THE CASTLE</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you are local to the area then you are probably aware of the iconic Fonthill Castle in the heart of Doylestown. What some people sometimes miss is that short building off to the side of the castle, which is appropriately named, The Tileworks. It’s the famous Henry Mercer factory where he created all of his Mercer tiles. The Tileworks offers daily tours and has a gift shop where you can buy tiles of your own, but they also host a bunch of events in the building and on the grounds. From Summer Clay Classes every Tuesday in August (ages 5-12) to a Clay Owl Planter Class (8/22 or 8/23) to a live Blue Grass show on the lawn (8/27, 1-6 pm) to a day-long festival featuring local music school, School of Rock’s aspiring young musicians (8/13, 10 am-9:30 pm), Tileworks has an array of events that you won’t want to miss this August.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The Tileworks • 130 E Swap Rd, Doylestown</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><a href=\"https://www.thetileworks.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s1\">https://www.thetileworks.org</span></a></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><i>Meghan is a writer and creative director.
