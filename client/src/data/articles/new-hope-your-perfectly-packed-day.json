And we’ve planned the perfect summer day for you.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong>Morning:</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p6\">Start your day off with coffee and a croissant or pastry from <span class=\"s3\">C’est La Vie French Bakery.</span> Grab a seat with your breakfast, read the paper, and watch the fog dissipate on the <span class=\"s3\">Delaware River</span>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s4\">Next, lace up your sneaks and walk the bridge to </span><span class=\"s5\">Lambertville.</span><span class=\"s4\"> Take a picture with one foot in each state and watch the turtles swim below. Combine your love of nature and fitness and walk or bike part (or all if your coffee was particularly effective) of the nearly 60-mile</span><span class=\"s5\"> Delaware Canal Tow Path</span><span class=\"s4\">. Need a bike? Rent one from </span><span class=\"s5\">New Hope Cyclery</span><span class=\"s4\">.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">With over 15 galleries and even more eclectic shops, the </span><span class=\"s3\">New Hope Visitors Center</span><span class=\"s1\"> on Mechanic Street is a great place to plan your day. Shoppers get your arms ready as you’ll be carrying home vintage clothing, books, jewelry, home décor, collectibles, hot sauce, tarot cards, crystals, records, and even comic books.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\">For those with young children (one to seven years old) prepurchase tickets online to the <span class=\"s3\">Bucks County Children’s Museum </span>to discover and play before the crowd arrives. Then hop on board the <span class=\"s3\">New Hope and Ivyland Railroad</span> for a 45-minute ride through the countryside with rides starting at 11 am.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong>Afternoon:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s6\">Get all the fixings for a healthy and delicious picnic at family-owned </span><span class=\"s5\">Soulberry Market</span><span class=\"s6\"> from their ready-to-go case or order fresh salads, warm bowls, and pressed juices. Take your picnic to </span><span class=\"s5\">Bowman’s Hill Wildflower Preserve</span><span class=\"s6\">, a five-minute drive south of town, where you can explore the trails and climb to the top of </span><span class=\"s5\">Bowman’s Hill Tower </span><span class=\"s6\">(combo tickets from $10-15). If a picnic isn’t your thing but you’ve worked up an appetite with all those trails and stairs, </span><span class=\"s5\">Bowman’s Tavern </span><span class=\"s6\">has a crowd-pleasing menu.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">If you prefer to stay in town there are many casual lunch options like pizza, burgers, vegan, Mexican, Indian, pubs, and breweries. Fuel up then hit up the shops you couldn’t squeeze in before lunch. Don’t forget a selfie with the town mascot </span><span class=\"s3\">Boomer </span><span class=\"s1\">at the south end of Main Street.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong>Evening:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"p6\">Adults 21 and over can enjoy the New Hope and Ivyland railroad too. Relax with wine and cheese on <span class=\"s3\">The Grape Vine Express</span> from 5-6 pm. Experience prohibition on <span class=\"s3\">The Speakeasy Train</span> from 7-8:30 pm.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">You can’t go wrong with the myriad of inviting dining options for dinner. Check out a place you couldn’t get into at lunch. But if you’re in the mood to splurge try </span><span class=\"s3\">Old Stone</span><span class=\"s1\"> or </span><span class=\"s3\">Stella</span><span class=\"s1\">. No dinner would be complete without something sweet from </span><span class=\"s3\">Moo Hope Ice Cream, Clusters Popcorn, Nina’s Waffles, </span><span class=\"s1\">or</span><span class=\"s3\"> The Last Temptation</span><span class=\"s1\">.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">Tap into the spiritual world with a psychic reading or reserve a spot on the walking </span><span class=\"s3\">Ghost Tour</span><span class=\"s1\"> offered on Saturday evenings at 8 pm.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span class=\"s1\">Stay up late with New Hope! Catch a show at the </span><span class=\"s3\">Bucks County Playhouse.</span><span class=\"s1\"> Grab a drink and discover live music at a local bar each with unique vibes. And if you’re exhausted from your fun-packed day, sleep in at one of the bed and breakfasts or inns.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">C’est La Vie French Bakery</span>, <span class=\"s1\">and</span> Carriage House<span class=\"s1\"> are all staples.</span></p>\n",
