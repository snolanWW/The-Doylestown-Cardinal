  "content": "<p class=\"p1\"><strong>By Migdalia Costante</strong> • Special to The Cardinal</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">S</span><span class=\"s1\">eptember is upon us and, with that the end of summer vacations, the start of a new school year, and fall sports, and soon, holiday music will be playing everywhere.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">But, did you know, that September is also Self-Care Awareness Month? A time to pause and remind ourselves that it is okay to take a break. Self-care is the practice of taking action to preserve or improve one’s own health. It includes all the things you do to take care of your overall well-being, emotionally, physically, psychologically, and spiritually. All of which affect our mental health!<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Self-Care not only benefits those who practice it, but it also benefits those around us because it promotes a more balanced and positive mindset. Self-Care offers so many benefits and over time those benefits build on one another. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s3\">In a world where most of us are accustomed to a symphony of alerts and notifications coming from our devices, it may be difficult to imagine even a moment of quiet.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Constant interruptions can be overwhelming causing anxiety and stress. Left unmanaged, stress will begin to manifest itself physically in our bodies (think headaches, low energy, feeling uninterested), which is why self-care needs to be your priority.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">September is the time to shift your mindset to Self-care. It is something that we can ALL practice each day and it can be as simple as spending 10-minutes outdoors listening to the wind blowing through the trees.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Contrary to what some might think, self-care is not selfish, it is necessary and allows you to check in with yourself. Carving out some time for yourself is not something you should feel guilty about. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong>What is floating and how can it jump-start your self-care routine?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">As you lay back into about 185 gallons of skin-temperature water, saturated with over 1,000 lbs. of Epsom salt, you’ll feel the tension melt away as you float effortlessly!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s4\">The idea is to block out all distractions so your mind and nervous system can get a much-needed rest. You are in full control of the experience. After a soothing shower, you are free to ease your way into your float session. You can listen to soft music and be showered in a rainbow of light and then work your way to full sensory deprivation. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Floating offers a natural way to improve your physical and mental well-being. While you’ll experience benefits during the float session itself, some benefits will stay with you for days afterward. In the zero-gravity environment, you may feel the tension you hold in your shoulders dissipate and then find that you’re sleeping better, breathing easier, and feeling more alert in the coming days. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><strong>Incorporating float therapy into your<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>self-care every few weeks can help:</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">• Reduce stress and anxiety</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">• Relieve chronic physical pain</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">• Aid in muscle recovery</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">• Improve sleep quality</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">• Increase focus and much more!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">All of which improve our well-being and allow us to rebalance. Free from all the distractions, connect with yourself in a way many of us haven’t experienced before!</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">Use the month of September to practice being good to yourself. Encourage others to make self-care a priority. Ask them if they’ve experienced float therapy before and schedule your very own session at <a href=\"http://www.doylestownfloat.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.doylestownfloat.com</a>.</span></p>\n",
