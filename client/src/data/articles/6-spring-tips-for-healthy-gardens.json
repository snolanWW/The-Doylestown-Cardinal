You throw on your gardening gloves, dust off the gardening tools, and greet your neighbors out on the lawn. Everyone enjoys those first warm days emerging from winter hibernation.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">If you find yourself wanting to spruce up your gardens this month, I have a few simple tips to offer. After completing several spring clean ups for our clients with Peacefield Farm Lawn and Tree Service, a local mowing and tree removal company, I am happy to share what I learned.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">As Doylestown residents and parents of two children under five, my husband Rob and I understand the time constraints many of us face. Here are six simple steps you can take to get your lawn and gardens ready for the summer.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong><span class=\"s4\">• Nip weeds and dead leaves in the bud:</span></strong><span class=\"s2\"> Spring is great time to pull out weeds before they go to seed and get a stronghold in your garden. Additionally, using a rake or leaf blower to remove stray leaves from the lawn, bushes, and garden beds can make an immediate improvement. Wet and matted leaves prevent grass growth and can make garden beds look drab.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong><span class=\"s4\">• Prune rose bushes.</span></strong><span class=\"s2\"> “When the forsythia bloom, it’s time to prune” is an easy rule of thumb to help remember when to start pruning rose bushes. Grab a sharp pair of garden shears. Clean them with rubbing alcohol beforehand to avoid spreading any disease. Remove dead or diseased branches, as well as broken or crossing stems. Then, at the base, remove any dead canes and continue pruning until you have three or four strong stems left. It may feel like you’re ruining your bush, but in reality, you’re forcing it to grow stronger.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong><span class=\"s4\">• Slit-seed grass or bare spots in your lawn to ensure a lush lawn all summer.</span></strong><span class=\"s2\"><strong><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></strong>If you’re the DIY type, check out a local rental vendor like Sunbelt Rentals to borrow a slit seeder for the weekend. However, you’re likely to get a better outcome if you leave this task to the professionals who have the techniques to ensure great germination. Feel free to give us a call at Peacefield Farm Lawn and Tree (267-481-4501) for a free estimate.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong><span class=\"s4\">• Fertilize azaleas and rhododendrons with Hollytone.</span></strong><span class=\"s2\"> Hollytone is an organic and natural fertilizer that is available at any local garden store. It can be applied in early spring and again in the late fall to any acid-loving plants, such as blueberries, camellias, rhododendrons, evergreens, and hydrangeas. Be sure to read the bag for specific instructions on how to apply based on the plant.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong><span class=\"s4\">• Mind your Trees.</span></strong><span class=\"s2\"> Winter can be a rough time for trees, as high winds and cold temperatures take their toll, particularly on trees that are already impaired with canker or insect issues. Take stock of the condition of your trees and check for broken branches or areas where that might benefit from pruning or limbing. For trees beyond repair, consider proper removal to open your yard to more sunlight and reduce the risks of falling trees during summer storms.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><strong><span class=\"s4\">• Add annuals to your gardens and flower baskets for beautiful color all summer long.</span></strong><span class=\"s2\"> After the last frost date &#8211; May 15th in this area &#8211; it’s time to start planting. Try companion planting bright marigolds in your vegetable garden. Add begonias and impatiens to shady spots, and fill your flower boxes with “thrillers, spillers, and fillers.” Come check out our family farm’s annual plant sale on the weekends of May<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>6, 13, 20, and 27 for a great selection of plants, planters, and hanging baskets. You can find our little farm five minutes outside of Doylestown proper at 85 Cherry Lane. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">Peacefield Farm Lawn and Tree Service, established in 2017, offers professional lawn mowing, landscape, and tree services.
