  "content": "<p><b>By Lauren Heine &#8211; Cardinal Contributing Writer</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cozy by definition is a feeling of comfort, warmth, and relaxation. It’s the vibes of plush seating, fireplaces, candlelight, intimate spaces, calm music, inviting colors, pizza (which can even be heart-shaped!) Are you looking for a cozy night with your love? Here’s your guide. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skip the crowds and stay in because there’s no place like home. Cozify your hangout with blankets, pillows, candles, and flowers. Light the fireplace or find a virtual one on TV (Netflix even has a Bridgerton version &#8211; swoon). Got kids? Arrange for childcare somewhere other than your home. Then cook a meal together &#8211; your favorite dish or a new recipe. If the thought of cooking together sounds like a relationship test, then order takeout. You can order from your favorite restaurant or go for a trip around the world with a dish from multiple ethnic restaurants. Snuggle up and watch a movie, binge a series, play board or video games, have a dance party, run a bubble bath, or have an adult conversation. There are so many possibilities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re not a homebody, or maybe your relationship is too new to bring home, but you want to find a cozy spot, where should you go? Fortunately, our area is full of historic old buildings and restaurants to provide a cozy atmosphere. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For dinner, try places like <a href=\"https://www.blackbasshotel.com/\">The Black Bass</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lambertvillestation.com/dining-wine.php\">The Lambertville Station Wine Cellar</a>, <a href=\"https://www.barleysheaf.com/\">Inn at Barley Sheaf Farm</a>, <a href=\"https://www.genevieveskitchen.com/\">Genevieve’s Kitchen</a>, <a href=\"https://bowmanstavernrestaurant.com/\">Bowman’s Tavern</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ameliabistro.com/\">Amelia</a> to name a few. For less colonial cozy, check out <a href=\"https://www.honeyrestaurant.com/\">Honey</a>, <a href=\"https://nektarnewhope.com/\">Nektar</a>, <a href=\"https://acquaefarinanapoli.com/\">Acqua E Farina</a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=Terrain+Cafe&amp;oq=Terrain+Cafe&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIZCAEQLhiDARivARjHARiRAhixAxiABBiKBTIQCAIQLhivARjHARiABBiOBTINCAMQLhivARjHARiABDIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIKCAcQABjJAxiABDIKCAgQABiSAxiABDIHCAkQABiABNIBBzM4OWowajSoAgCwAgA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">Terrain Cafe</a>, <a href=\"https://lastallarestaurant.com/\">La Stalla</a>, <a href=\"https://getforky.com/tavola-rustica/\">Tavolo Rustica</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.dbums.com/\">Dharma Bums</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For cozy activities, take a tour of historic sites like Fonthill Castle, visit an art gallery, or browse the books together at one of Bucks County’s 18 libraries. If relaxation is in order, you can enjoy spa services at one of the area&#8217;s day spas. Try a new class together like cooking, mixology, yoga, painting, pottery, or wine/spirit tasting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up for an adventure? Plan a road trip to see the 12 covered bridges in Bucks County with a thermos of hot chocolate and a personalized playlist. Bundle up to go stargazing at one of Bucks&#8217; six state parks with your warmest blankets and an astronomy book or app. Visit the Delaware River Towns of PA and NJ and stroll the Tow Path or shop the quaint streets. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“So many choices, so little time,” one may think.. Au contraire, mon cheri! This year Valentine’s Day spans Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Besides, the cozy season doesn’t end on Valentine’s Day. It’s still cold well into March. Embrace your cozy era! </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
