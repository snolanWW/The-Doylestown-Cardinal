  "content": "<p><b>By Danielle Gannon &#8211; Cardinal Contributing Writer</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have always been very open and interested in alternative ways of healing the mind and body. The idea that our entire system is connected has always intrigued me. I believe that our emotional health plays a big part in our physical health. I first became interested in this way of thinking in 2013. At the time, I had a two-year-old, a one-month-old, and an organic market business slated to open in September of that year. I was tandem breastfeeding both babies, working full-time from home in the corporate world, opening the store, and beginning to dabble with essential oils and alternative modalities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2015, a rash developed all over my body. I went to the dermatologist, who called the condition Granuloma Annulare. The doctor had no idea what caused it and no idea how to fix it, but gave me a steroid cream. I was so against this because I was pregnant with my third child. I didn’t know what to expect to happen from using a topical steroid like this, or what the implications would be on my fetus and I wasn’t willing to risk it. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s when I found Bridge Acupuncture in Doylestown. I called and explained my situation over the phone to Grace Rollins, the owner of the practice. She compassionately listened to my situation and scheduled me to come in and visit with Paolo. I experienced a process called moxibustion, “moxa”. Moxa is an ancient process part of Chinese medicine that involves the heating of incense on acupoints and applied to the body. Every time I went to Paolo, I felt more relaxed and the moxa felt like it opened the channels in my body to move around. This relaxed me, relaxed my skin condition, and gave me an overall sense of wellness.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This year, I have had a lot of trouble sleeping and digestion issues. I spoke to the experts at Bridge and they suggested coming in to see Suzie for an acupuncture treatment. Suzie was so calm and relaxed, she asked me some questions and truly listened to my concerns. She put me on the table, treated me on the backside for approximately 30 minutes, and then flipped me over to the right side and needled me. In the end, she inserted what are called “ear seeds,” to assist in the rest of mind and body. I left the seeds in for about a week. I slept like a baby the entire time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paolo hosted an event at the practice in June called Psychology and Eastern Medicine. He focused on the teachings of the Dao (or Tao), which relates to the book by Lao Tzu, The Dao De Jing (or the Tao Te Ching). Daoism teaches that all living creatures ought to live in a state of harmony with the universe, and the energy found in it. During the workshop, Paolo touched on the principles of yin and yang. Also connecting the different body organs to the emotions and aliments we feel as humans. This has always been incredibly interesting to me. Chinese medicine has a basic concept that a vital force of life called Qi (pronounced chi), that surges through the body. Any imbalance of the Qi can cause disease and illness. At Bridge Acupuncture, the practitioners use both Japanese and Chinese acupuncture as well as Chinese Herbal Medicine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The practice is composed of four acupuncturists: Grace, Paolo, Misook, and Suzie. Each one of them has a special way of handling each patient. Rosa, another practitioner at Bridge, is a breath coach, focusing her teachings on the Buteyko Method. This is said to help with respiratory, neurological, and sleep conditions as well as childhood development. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few times a year the practice hosts workshops, classes, and open houses in the studio. Attending one of these is a great way to meet each of the practitioners and see who you connect to. You may also call the practice and describe your situation. The staff will listen compassionately and put you in the right hands. The practice is celebrating 15 years in Doylestown this year. How wonderful it is to see a successful business that is nurturing the community, with the community nurturing it right back.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next up is a Women’s Health workshop with Misook and Suzie. “Understanding Weight Gain and Sleep Loss During Menopause: An Eastern Medicine Perspective.” Wednesday, July 17, 6-7:30 p.m. RSVP: 215-348-8058.
