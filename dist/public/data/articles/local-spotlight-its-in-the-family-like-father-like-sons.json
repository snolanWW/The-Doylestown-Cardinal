Soon after, he sold two properties to investors, saw the money they made, and thought, “Why aren’t we doing this?” His brokerage quickly expanded and began to focus on the whole scope of real estate, buying, selling, investing, and property management.</span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_19883\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19883\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dave__and_Matthew_Summer_20013_660476112159086.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-large wp-image-19883\" src=\"https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dave__and_Matthew_Summer_20013_660476112159086-1024x959.jpg\" alt=\"Dave and Mathew Summer 2001\" width=\"1024\" height=\"959\" srcset=\"https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dave__and_Matthew_Summer_20013_660476112159086-1024x959.jpg 1024w, https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dave__and_Matthew_Summer_20013_660476112159086-300x281.jpg 300w, https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dave__and_Matthew_Summer_20013_660476112159086-768x720.jpg 768w, https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dave__and_Matthew_Summer_20013_660476112159086-990x928.jpg 990w, https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dave__and_Matthew_Summer_20013_660476112159086.jpg 1204w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-19883\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dave and Mathew Summer 2001</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matt, Dave’s son, wasn’t even born when his father first launched the brokerage </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">but grew up immersed in a life of real estate. After graduating from Council Rock South, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he went off to the University of South Carolina to major in finance and real estate. At the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">age of 19, Matt decided to get his Real Estate License, and instead of pursuing a career in corporate finance, he joined his dad at Franklin Investment Realty. “It just made sense! I grew up in the real estate industry, I was now ready to make some professional moves, create relationships, and make some money,” Matt says. “It cut the learning curve in half,” Dave adds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Matt’s priority was growing the investment footprint and laying out some new infrastructure to expand the retail side of the brokerage. In 2019, Matt was knee-deep in all of it, purchasing and fully renovating his own home, and working to expand Franklin Investment Realty. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His experience helps in carefully assisting first-time home buyers, because he, too, was one at the onset of this crazy market and has a wealth of knowledge. Matt curates a family-run, boutique brokerage with his father as the broker and they collaboratively hand-select a few agents to carry out their mission. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brianna, one of their newest agents, and mom to six-month-old Jonah, comes from a background in upscale retail sales. She connected with Matt a few years ago but met back up after Jonah was born. She moved her license to hang it with Franklin Investment Realty. “I love the small family feel of the brokerage, “says Brianna. “They 100% respect my role as a mama bear, they cater to family life because they are family.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last year, another Scannapieco, Dan, Dave’s youngest son joined the team. Dan works with The Michaels Organization, a real estate development company that focuses on large multi-family developments. He works closely with various banks and institutions providing financial due diligence for developments. He collaborates with developers, architects, construction managers, and other parties involved throughout the process to ensure a smooth and efficient development. When he’s not working, he enjoys hopping on a plane, to see the world and play golf. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The newest agent at the company, John Pizzigoni, brings a unique blend of business acumen and personal dedication to Franklin Investment Realty, navigating clients through the complex landscape of real estate investment and home ownership. John quickly showcased his entrepreneurial spirit by launching Astro Gym in Philadelphia. This venture not only honed his customer service and management skills but also deepened his understanding of sales dynamics and client relations. Having successfully purchased his first home in Feasterville with his fiancée, Jeanne, and their golden retriever, Louie, John understands the emotional and financial significance of finding the perfect home or investment property.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sitting with their team, it was evident there was a true sense of comfort amongst them </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all. Baby Jonah was sitting on his mom’s lap at the table, while we all discussed real </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">estate and their story. Dave sat back with pride observing his son Matt, and letting him </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">take the lead. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are not in the business of charging extra fees and adding stress to the real estate </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">process. We take a hands-on approach to understanding clients’ needs and deliver top-tier results in every facet of the business,” Matt says. “We are with them for the life-cycle of the house. We know the area and property intimately. ” </span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_19884\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19884\" style=\"width: 768px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MattandDaveFranklinInvestmentRealty.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-large wp-image-19884\" src=\"https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MattandDaveFranklinInvestmentRealty-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Dave and Mathew 2020\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MattandDaveFranklinInvestmentRealty-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MattandDaveFranklinInvestmentRealty-225x300.jpg 225w, https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MattandDaveFranklinInvestmentRealty-990x1320.jpg 990w, https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MattandDaveFranklinInvestmentRealty-1320x1760.jpg 1320w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-19884\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dave and Mathew 2020</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company is licensed exclusively in Pennsylvania, but Matt recently acquired his NJ license to help better serve clients across the river. The Scannpieco family runs deep in Bucks County emphasizing “family first, and the rest all works out exactly the way it’s supposed to,” Dave affirms.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information, visit Franklin Investment Realty, <a href=\"http://franklininvestmentrealty.com,\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">franklininvestmentrealty.com</a> or call (215) 382-7368</span></i></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Danielle Gannon<br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Founder &amp; Creative Director<br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Local Spotlight with Danielle<br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">267-980-2176 </span><a href=\"http://www.localspotlightwithdanielle.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">www.localspotlightwithdanielle.com</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;The Voice Behind Small Business&#8221;</span></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
