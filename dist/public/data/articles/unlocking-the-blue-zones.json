This is the term that refers to the geographical locations around the world with people who are the healthiest and longest-living individuals. In fact, many live well past ninety or more. These remarkable individuals maintain an active, rewarding, and interconnected life with those around them well into their later years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The top five Blue Zone areas are Okinawa, Japan, Sardinia, Italy, Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica, Icaria, Greece, and Loma Linda California. Geography, culture, diet, lifestyle, outlook, and a strong sense of purpose rich in tradition are some key ingredients in this recipe for longevity. These exceptional generations are not just alive longer, they are thriving.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Numerous scientists studied the Blue Zone cultures at length. They’ve collected fascinating data showing a multitude of parallels in the diet and lifestyle routines of those living throughout the varied Blue Zones. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Examining what they eat revealed that the majority tend to consume primarily a plant-based diet. They do eat some meat and fish, but in very small quantities. Their diets consist of a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, beans, whole grains, and nuts. Many believe in the mantra: eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper. So mealtimes are enjoyed in much smaller portions. They also grow much of what they eat. This adds hard labor, with duties of sowing and harvesting crops from their fields as part of their daily chores. </span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_19632\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-19632\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/8899413_orig.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-large wp-image-19632\" src=\"https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/8899413_orig-1024x531.jpeg\" alt=\"Blue Zone Characteristics\" width=\"1024\" height=\"531\" srcset=\"https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/8899413_orig-1024x531.jpeg 1024w, https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/8899413_orig-300x155.jpeg 300w, https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/8899413_orig-768x398.jpeg 768w, https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/8899413_orig-990x513.jpeg 990w, https://doylestowncardinal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/8899413_orig.jpeg 1100w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-19632\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.exploreshelbycounty.com/blue-zones-projectreg.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shelby County Chamber of Commerce</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People in the Blue Zones also appreciate spending much of their time outside in the sunshine. Fresh air and time spent outdoors provide them with a natural mental lift in mood and happiness, as well as a positive sense of well-being. Very few in the Blue Zones have clinical depression, insomnia, or neurological decline with aging. Their healthful living has also been shown to be preventative against many diseases like dementia and chronic conditions like diabetes or heart disease.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Socialization is also a priority. These individuals are dedicated to making time for community gatherings. They are tightly interconnected with the young as well as the old. They live life with a sense of humor, lend a helping hand when needed, and enjoy a few sips of red wine on occasion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, these individuals maintain an ongoing sense of purpose. They feel an important reason for living and for getting up each day. They actively seek out and contribute to family and community needs. Some work jobs they love that fulfill them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These super seniors are living out their dreams still, by maintaining powerful social connections that keep them feeling alive, valued, fulfilled, and thriving. </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Jill Sonlin</strong> has lived in Doylestown and surrounding areas her entire life.
